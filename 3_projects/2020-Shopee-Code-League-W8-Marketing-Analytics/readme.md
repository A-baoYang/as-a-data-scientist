#### Topic

Build a model that can **predict whether a user opens the emails sent by Shopee**.

Sending emails is one of the marketing channels Shopee uses to reach out to our users. 
The advantage of predicting email opens is able to forecast and evaluate the performance of future marketing campaigns before launch. 
Once a user opens an email, the probability of the user knowing the campaign increases and this in turn increases the probability of making a checkout during the campaign period. 
Therefore, with the predicted open rates, Shopee can better develop, strategize and implement future marketing campaigns.
