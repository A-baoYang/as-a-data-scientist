#### Topic

Optimize the packing operation by determining **the most viable carton box in the least space-wasteful way** for the warehouse since the larger one cost higher.

- Constraints:
    - Items **CANNOT** be placed oblique or be extruding from the box.

- Special Cases:
    - If 2 boxes are both the most viable ones to an order with the same volume, decide by the packing-box ID order. (priority: box id=1 > box id=2)
    - If thereâ€™s no one carton able to contain the items of an order, please specify the box_number as `UNFITTED`.
